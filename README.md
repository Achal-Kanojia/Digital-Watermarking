# Digital-Watermarking
This was a course project completed under the digital systems course in a team of 5 members. The primary aim of the project was to To verify the authenticity of oneâ€™s digital watermarked property.
## Project Description
Digital watermarking is an important branch of information hiding technology. First, we will read the image. Then, the process of embedding the watermark on the input image will be carried out. The reversible image watermarking algorithm based on discrete cosine transformation uses the DCT algorithm to embed the watermark. The watermarked image is added with filters that will tamper the originally obtained watermarked image. Finally, the filtered watermark is extracted and compared in terms of whether it is tampered or not using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).
