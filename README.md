# Digital-Watermarking
This was a course project completed under the digital systems course in a team of 5 members. The primary aim of the project was to To verify the authenticity of oneâ€™s digital watermarked property.
## Project Description
Digital watermarking is an important branch of information hiding technology. We started off by reading the image using MATLAB. Then, moved on to the process of embedding the watermark on the input image. The reversible image watermarking algorithm based on discrete cosine transformation uses the DCT algorithm to embed the watermark. A filter is applied to the watermarked image to introduce some changes to the originally obtained watermarked image. Finally, the filtered watermark is extracted and compared in terms of whether it is tampered or not using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM).
